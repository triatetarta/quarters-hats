# Gatsby Shopify starter

**Getting started**

First you'll need to add a `.env` file to the root of your project consisting of:

```
GATSBY_SHOP_NAME=
GATSBY_ACCESS_TOKEN=
```

And enter the appropriate values from your own shopify store.

Then run `gatsby develop` and you're off to the races!

Checkout is fully functional but you won't be charged. It uses Bogus just for testing and demonstration purpose.
To complete a virtual payment just use "1" for card number, "Bogus Gateway" for Name on card, any future date and a random three digits number for security code.
